# ROS 2 MuJoCo Simulation for Franka Robotics Panda (FER)

This repository provides a high-fidelity physics simulation for the FER robot using **MuJoCo** and **ROS 2 Jazzy**. It uses the `mujoco_ros2_control` framework and ships a fully Dockerized workflow with CycloneDDS for low-latency inter-process communication.

## Key Features
* **Modular URDF Wrapper**: Uses a top-level Xacro wrapper to inject MuJoCo physics without modifying upstream Franka packages.
* **Dockerized Workflow**: Consistent development environment with all dependencies (MuJoCo, MoveIt, ros2_control, CycloneDDS) pre-configured.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your host machine:
* **Docker** (latest version)
* **vcstool**: To manage repository dependencies.
  ```bash
  pip install vcstool
  ```

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GKnerd/fer_ros2_simulation.git
cd fer_ros2_simulation
```

2. Create the source directory and import dependencies:
```bash
mkdir -p ros2_ws/src
vcs import ros2_ws/src < fer_ros2_mujoco.repos
```

3. Build the Docker image:
```bash
./.docker/build_image.sh
```
This builds the image, compiles the full ROS 2 workspace inside the container, and copies the built workspace back to `ros2_ws/` on your host.

## Running the Simulation

0. Prelaunch setup:
**Crucial**
CycloneDDS requires a massive receive buffer to reliably handle large trajectory messages without dropping packets. You must configure your Host OS kernel to allow this, or the Docker container will crash on boot.
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
```
>Note 1: To make this persist across reboots, add `net.core.rmem_max=2147483647` to your `/etc/sysctl.conf file`.
>Note 2: You don´t have to specify 2GBs as here, this is use case specific. The value was chosen arbitratily in this case. 

1. Launch the container:
```bash
./.docker/run_container.sh
```

2. Inside the container, run the main launch file:
```bash
ros2 launch franka_mujoco_sim_bringup fer_mujoco_ros2_control.launch.py
```
This opens the MuJoCo simulator and activates the effort controller for the arm and an effort controller for the hand.

If you wish to use the Mujoco simulator with MoveIt and an activated effort controller for the hand and arm you can use this launch file instead.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_mujoco_sim_bringup fer_mujoco_moveit.launch.py
```
